   <h2>Web Developer | AI Enthusiast</h2>
   <p>Hi there. I am a computer science and mathematics double major from Georgetown University. I am currently learning how to build stuff from zero to one, and it is impact-oriented learning that drives my interests in making stuff work better — I apply all of this working in software development, business operations, nonprofit work, and a couple of other institutional settings. This summer, I’m further taking courses @ Georgetown and building AI projects that can sharpen my passion for building.</p>
